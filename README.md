#### Description: 
A weather App which displayes weather of the city the user ask for along with some random gifs related to the weather data

#### Tech Stack Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Webpack
- node

I learned Javascript and later on exploring forntend technologies came across the webpack , which is a Js Bundler to bundle multiple js files so the the js code is easily maintainable.

Apart from tech stack i used api from accuweather for current weather and giphty's api to get a random giph according to the weather type.

Also i learned a lot about css and varous css properties such as blur and various js concepts such as asnync await which is used to get data from the above mentioned API's.
